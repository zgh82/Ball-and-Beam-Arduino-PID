# Ball and Beam Control System with Arduino

## Project Objective  
Control and stabilize the position of the ball on the beam using a PID algorithm.

## Equipment Used  
- Arduino Uno board  
- Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04  
- Servo motor  
- Mechanical components for the Ball and Beam setup  

## Control Algorithm  
PID algorithm is used to control the ballâ€™s position on the beam.

## Development Environment  
Arduino IDE and C++ programming language.

## Project Implementation  
This project has been practically implemented and is not just a simulation.  
To run the code, open the Arduino sketch in Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino board.

## Circuit and Schematics  
Pin connections and circuit diagrams are included in the project report.

## Video  
A demonstration video of the implemented project is available in the `videos` folder.
